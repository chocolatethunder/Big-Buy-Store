The main goal of this project was to understand how to design and implement a relational database. Creating a marketplace provided the opportunity to show and explore various types of SQL operations. First an EER Model was created.

The database was then created on the Amazon RDS platform with the help of both PHPMyAdmin and MySQL connect via terminal. In order to demonstrate its functionality a nice and simple front end was created to help interact with the database. 

The platform was intentionally designed to serve three types of users - seller, buyers, and moderators(employees). The users could login and signup as base buyer users and could apply to upgrade their status to sellers which was controlled by the moderators on the platform.
